      <h1>About Auriel</h1>
    <p> Auriel Krumwiede was born and raised in Lewistown, Montana. She has one younger and one older brother along with a horse, dog, and two cats. Auriel enjoys anything outdoors especially if there is a chance to play with a camera. She has always had a love for creativity with cameras and photos. During her senior year of high school, she was a part of the yearbook committee and also took senior pictures for her friends and for others who couldn't afford them. She is currently attending Carroll College where she plans to major in Computer Information Systems. She knows very little about cameras and editing photos but has always loved taking pictures as a pastime and playing around with Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.</p>
