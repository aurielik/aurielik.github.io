    <h1><a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm">New Hampshire</a></h1>
        <p>This is my favorite webpage because it has a simple home page but it is still easy to find needed links. It has a nice design and the text is bigger making things easier to read. It also fits to any size screen. I also like the linked tiles at the bottom for easy navigation.</p>
        
    <h1><a href="https://az.gov/">Arizona</a></h1>
        <p>I really like how this page is set up. I like the images and the colors. It makes it hard to navigate through the site though. I like how they have the drop down bar and links set up. This would be my favorite website but it is almost too detailed for a state webiste. </p>
        
    <h1><a href="https://mt.gov/">Montana</a></h1>
        <p>I don't like the colors on this page, they're dark and boring. It doesn't catch peoples attention as much. I like all of the info provided on the home page. I also like that they have theire social media linked on the homepage.</p>
        
    <h1><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska</a></h1>
        <p>This webpage conforms to any size screen which is really nice. The state's name isn't on the home page other than in the given link which could cause confusion to some people. I like how the page is set up and the search bar is obvious. I don't like how the links do not have a drop down option and instead you are redirected to a new page with more links. Also, the picture on the homepage is grainy. </p>
        
  <h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/" new>Alaska</a></h1>
        <p>This page is my least favorite because it has too much information in really litle font. I like the pictures on the home page but there's too much going on. This page doesn't fit on any screen, it just has one size which makes it hard to see everything. I like how they have things organized but I don't like how small the font is. </p>
