    <h1>Two Good Websites and One Bad Website</h1>
    <p>The first good website I chose was <a href="https://www.carroll.edu/home" target="_new">Carroll College</a>. I like this website because it follows the same theme on every page, it has easy navigation, and the text is easy to read. Also, when it is resized, the page is still very easy to read and navigate. The code is organized and uses HTML and there are columns used. The layout makes sense and it is easy to find different things. It includes news and events and different links to those news and events. The footer is creative but you can still navigate easily within it. The whole home page scrolls but there isn't anything that scrolls within the page which makes the page look more organized in my opinion. The colors follow the Carroll College theme. The plain white background makes the purple stand out. The designer of this website obviously made the College stand out while making it simple enough for people to navigate around the site. The images and icons that are used add a cool look and the layout in general is very organized and eye-catching. </p>
        
    <p> The second good website I chose was  <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_new">Pinterest</a>. I really like this website because it has a pleasing look, easy navigation, and the layout is pleasing. They are using HTML but the coding looks a little confusing. This website shows posts in columns and rows that relate to your searches within the website so the home page is different for everyone and it catches each individual's eye. Sometimes the navigation within different posts is confusing. The only colors there are is red and white but it makes the colors in the pictures stick out. Every time you click refresh or home, new posts are added which changes up the site but still keeps it interesting. The images that pop up have curved corners and space between each post so there is white space and it looks organized and pleasing to the eye. You can also customize your account by making and saving posts. Pinterest also offers a "Request a Feature" link where you can request your own ideas to making the site better. </p>
        
    <p> The bad website I chose was a site dedicated to <a href="https://jamilin.com" target="_new">Jami Lin</a>. This website looks like it is for a person ("Jami Lin") but you can't really tell because there is so much going on. This site is very loud and the layout is very unorganized. The navigation seems decent but there are too many colors. The font colors and sizes are all over the place. The code looks super simple and is in HTML. Everything is in the middle 50% of the screen no matter how you resize it. There is no white space and when you click on other navigation links, you are overwhelmed with different colors. The grammar in some spots is confusing. The navigation links take you to different themed sites that look nothing alike. The navigation bar itself is almost confusing because some links are smaller than others, nothing is equal sized. This website also has too many different things going on in it. There are youtube videos linked in weird spots and some of the pictures are quite displeasing to the eye. I'm not sure what the main point of this website is supposed to be. </p>
